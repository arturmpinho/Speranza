## **Project Goal** 

***Speranza***, the italian word for ***Hope***.

The main goal of this project is to give a pinch of hope to cancer patients and their friends and relatives by introducing them to the latest advancements within the *immunotherapy* world, contributing to an easier access to clinical trials information available worldwide.

On top of this, provide the any user to share their stories about any given clinical trial.

***"Hope is the life we live, the attitude we carry, the gift we give others. Hope is the energy, the courage and the strength to keep believing in the goodness of life, God and the people around us."***

***Froyle Davies***

### **Design Choices**
#### Fonts
![Mokup Image](wireframes/speranza_fonts.png)

#### Icons
Throughout out the website, I will be using icons provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "FontAwesome").

The icons used are self-explanatory and aid the navigation of the user, bringing an intuitive imagery to the website.

#### Colors
![Mokup Image](wireframes/speranza_color_palette.png)

#### Structure

The structure of this website will be quite simple as the main focus is on the data handling. Therefore, the website will consist of mainly 3 pages, the Landing Page, the Clinical Trials and the User's Dashboard page.

##### Navigation bar and Footer
Throuhgout the entire website, the user will constantly have access to the Navigation bar, displaying according to the need the necessary sections. 

Concerning the footer, it will display some contact information and any other less relevant content.

##### Landing Page
The Landing page will showcase the immunotherapy as the future of medecine with a brief introduction. Also, an inspirational sentence will give the user the proper perception of the webpage intent.

Below, the user will be able to see the most recent clinical trials, but without accessing all the details. If the user wants to see more details, they will have to properly register in order to acess the entire set of clinical trials and the corresponding details.

Also, on top of the landing page, considering the recurrent users, two call-to-action buttons will be displayed to improve the navigation.

##### User's authentication
The user's authentication method used on this website is based on the corresponding lesson of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ "Code Institue") Full Stack Software Development Course.


##### Clinical Trials
After a user is registered and logged in, it will have full access to the entire set of clinical trials, powered by a search feature in order to easily find the most suitable clinical trial for its needs.

All the clinical trials will be displayed as cards that will include an icon to shortlist the clinical trial or a trash bin icon if the user wants to remove it from through this page and not through its own dashboard.

##### User's Dashboard
The user's dashboard will only display the shorlisted clinical trials, including as well the search feature in case it is needed.

##### Comments Sections
The comments section will only be displayd when the user is logged in, and will be available through a modal where all the comments for any given clinical trial will be displayed, sorted by date (newest first).
